# AppleSystemSounds

Small demo app to listen to all available System Sounds that iOS offers AFAIK. If there are sounds missing, feel free to open a PR. 

The App uses https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiotoolbox/ to play System Sounds. 

## List of System Sounds

This is the list of System Sounds that are currently in the App

### Playing System Sounds
```
  import AudioToolbox

  /// typealias SystemSoundID = UInt32
  let systemSoundID: SystemSoundID = 1106

  /// Use this if you just want to play the sound
  AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(systemSoundID)

  /// Use this if you want a callback to know if the sound is finished playing:
  AudioServicesPlaySystemSoundWithCompletion(systemSoundID) {
    print("Done playing")
  }

  /// Use this if you want it to stop playing
  AudioServicesDisposeSystemSoundID(systemSoundID)

```
